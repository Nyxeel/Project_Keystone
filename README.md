# Keystone – Resonance City System
### Server Concept (Work in Progress)

---

## Status
**Work in Progress – Core System Phase**

---

## Vision

Keystone is a modular PvE multiplayer server built around:

- Collective city progression  
- Player-driven economy  
- Long-term world evolution  

Instead of a traditional protection shield, each city is powered by a **Resonance Crystal** — a central energy core that shapes the city’s identity, growth, and interaction with the world.

> The crystal does not merely defend the city.  
> It defines its evolution.

---

# 1. Server Structure

## 1.1 Keystone Hub (Persistent City World)

- No world resets  
- Central social and economic hub  
- Player-owned plots (32×32 blocks)  
- Maximum 4 plots per account  

### Plot Usage

Plots can be used for:

- Housing  
- Shops  
- Infrastructure  
- Community projects  

Each plot contains a **Claim Crystal** for ownership management.

---

## 1.2 PvE Farm Worlds (Weekly Reset)

- Resource gathering  
- Mob combat  
- Exploration  
- Rare materials from dangerous regions  

All items can be transported back to the Hub.

Energy crystals drop naturally during normal PvE gameplay.  
Energy farming is integrated into standard progression.

> No separate grind system.

---

# 2. The Resonance Crystal (Core Mechanic)

Each city is built around a central **Resonance Crystal**.

The crystal generates resonance — a stabilizing field that shapes the surrounding environment and enables city progression.

It is not a defensive shield.  
It is a civilization core.

---

## 2.1 Two Energy Layers

### A) Operational Energy (Upkeep)

- Generated through normal PvE activity  
- Used to maintain basic city stability  
- Prevents degradation of infrastructure  
- Shared through player contributions  

This is continuous maintenance energy.

It keeps the system running.

---

### B) Resonance Progress Energy (Long-Term Investment)

To upgrade the crystal, the city must invest:

- Large quantities of refined energy  
- Rare materials from higher regions  
- Event-based drops  
- Major community resource contributions  

Crystal upgrades are milestone events.  
They are not daily occurrences.

Progression is intentionally slow and long-term.

---

# 3. Crystal Growth & City Evolution

As the Resonance Crystal levels up, the city visibly evolves.

Progress is architectural, functional, and systemic — not just numerical.

---

## Example Progression Stages

### Stage 0 – Outpost

- Small central crystal  
- Basic infrastructure  
- Limited NPC presence  
- Minimal bonuses  

---

### Stage 1 – Stabilized Settlement

- Increased resonance radius  
- Production efficiency bonuses  
- Additional NPC traders appear  
- Public infrastructure improves  

---

### Stage 2 – Urban Center

- Manifested city structures (walls, halls, towers)  
- Advanced crafting stations unlock  
- Rare merchants visit  
- Environmental aesthetic changes  

---

### Stage 3 – Resonance Nexus

- High-tier crafting systems unlock  
- City-wide bonuses expand  
- Unique PvE events become possible  
- Major public constructions activate  

---

### Stage 4 – Metropolis

- The city influences surrounding regions  
- Special expedition content unlocks  
- Global event interactions possible  
- Crystal becomes a world-level landmark  

Crystal growth is visible and meaningful.

---

# 4. Resonance & World Interaction

As resonance increases, the city gains advantages — but also visibility.

High resonance may:

- Attract rare traders  
- Trigger special PvE events  
- Cause mana anomalies  
- Draw attention from energy-seeking entities  

Events are not scheduled waves.  
They are probabilistic resonance reactions.

> No tower-defense mechanics.  
> The world reacts organically to energy concentration.

---

# 5. Claim System

Each player plot contains a **Claim Crystal**.

### Properties

- Visibly placed  
- Non-tradeable  
- Non-automatable  
- Central management object  

### Displays

- Remaining upkeep time  
- Contribution log  
- Stability state indicator  

Claim upkeep energy contributes indirectly to city resonance.

Private plots remain protected regardless of city level.

# 6. Economy Framework

## Currency

- 100 Copper = 1 Silver  
- 100 Silver = 1 Gold  

---

## Income Sources

- Resource trading  
- Player shops  
- Crafting services  
- Expedition rewards  
- Event participation  

---

## Gold Sinks

- Plot upkeep  
- City infrastructure investments  
- NPC services  
- Cosmetic unlocks  
- Public construction projects  

Economic balance is maintained through sinks, not artificial restrictions.

---

# 7. Design Philosophy

- The Resonance Crystal represents civilization, not defense  
- Growth unlocks potential, not obligation  
- Upkeep is integrated into normal gameplay  
- Progress is collective and visible  
- Power increases opportunity — and attention  
- No artificial grind loops  
- No forced event cycles  

> The city is not protected from the world.  
> It becomes important to it.

---

# Next Focus

- Detailed crystal progression mechanics  
- Long-term upgrade pacing  
- Future specialization paths
