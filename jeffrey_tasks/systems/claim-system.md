## Housing, Prestige & Migration Overview

This document consolidates all previously discussed Claim-related systems:
plot ownership, housing voting, prestige mechanics, city migration, and structural expansion.

---

# 1. City Structure

- 2 fixed cities located on the same main island
- Players start in a central hub and choose a city via portal
- Players cannot found new cities or place a city crystal
- Both cities start with identical progression
- No wild building outside designated plots
- Initial capacity: 20–25 plots per city
- Expansion requires crystal level + mana pool investment

---

# 2. Core Rule

**1 plot per player**

Players may:

- Cooperate by building adjacent plots
- Form architectural districts
- Participate in collective city development

---

# 3. Two Housing Paths

## Path A – Default House (Immediate Access)

### Purpose
Safe and immediate entry into city life.

### Properties

- Instantly available
- Fully buildable (storage, crafting, decoration)
- No initial housing vote
- No prestige bonus
- Standard mana efficiency (baseline)
- Normal decay / upkeep costs

### Optional Structural Limits

- Limited build height or area
- No aura / prestige visual effects

---

### Upgrade: Default → Designer Plot

Players may upgrade at any time.

#### Requirements

- Processed energy crystals
- Activation via city crystal
- Moderate effort (e.g. 2–5 hours of normal gameplay)

#### Important

- No house reset
- No item loss
- No rebuild required
- Existing structure becomes a Designer Plot

#### After Upgrade

- Full creative freedom
- Housing voting activated
- Prestige system unlocked
- Mana-efficiency bonuses become possible

**Design Philosophy:**

Default = Stability
Designer = Influence

Players evolve from residents to contributors.

---

# 4. Housing Voting System

## Phase 1 – Building Phase

- Duration: 3–5 days
- Plot remains protected

## Phase 2 – Voting Phase

- Duration: 3 full days
- Plot remains protected
- All votes conclude at a fixed daily time (e.g. 20:00 server time)

Voting becomes a recurring civic ritual.

---

## Minimum Participation Rule

Voting result is valid only if:

**max(5 votes, 35% of total plot owners)**

This prevents small-group manipulation.

---

# 5. Mana Seal (Public Result Display)

After each vote, a floating Mana Seal appears above the plot.

### Displays

- Status: In Voting / Approved / Rejected
- Participation percentage (e.g. 63.4%)
- Optional rejection history

### Important

- No individual vote transparency
- No names displayed
- Only collective result is public

### Visual Feedback

- Below minimum participation → unstable glow
- Valid vote → strong glow
- Finalization → short mana pulse

---

# 6. Prestige System

Approved buildings gain Prestige.

### Effects

- Visual aura / stronger seal
- Optional particles or resonance sound
- Mechanical bonus: increased mana efficiency

### Rules

- Not pay-to-win
- Small but meaningful bonus
- Hard capped (~10–15%)
- Prestige increases only city mana output
- Does not grant personal combat advantage

---

# 7. Mana Efficiency Logic

No punishment model.

- Default house = baseline efficiency
- Approved building = higher output from same energy

Example:

- 100 energy → 100 mana (default)
- 100 energy → 105–115 mana (prestige)

Good design strengthens the city.

---

# 8. Failed Vote Consequences (First Attempt)

If a Designer Plot vote is rejected:

1. Player loses designer build rights
2. Player is automatically assigned a Default Plot
3. 2-day transition period to move items
4. After deadline:
   - Building removed
   - Plot neutralized

Player may upgrade again later and re-enter voting.

No permanent exile.

---

# 9. Civic Resonance (Voting Participation Bonus)

## Trigger

- Voting cycles last 3 days
- All votes conclude simultaneously (e.g. 20:00)

## Condition

If a player participated in all valid housing votes completed in that cycle:

- Gains +3–5% mana efficiency
- Duration: 24 hours
- Not stackable
- Only valid votes count (minimum participation reached)

This encourages civic engagement without coercion.

---

# 10. City Migration System

## Design Goal

Migration is allowed, but meaningful.

Players are energy contributors.
Leaving affects city progression.

---

## Migration Rules

- 10-day cooldown between switches
- Prestige reset to 0
- 48 hours no voting rights in new city
- Start in Default Plot only
- No immediate designer upgrade
- No immediate access to city roles

---

## Impact on Former City

Upon leaving:

- Player stops contributing mana
- Prestige output removed
- City roles revoked automatically

City progression slows proportionally.

---

## Design Principles

- No hard punishment
- No permanent exile
- No tactical vote manipulation
- Large cities remain stable but must retain players

Migration is strategic, not trivial.

---

# 11. City Expansion Logic

- Starts with 20–25 plots
- Expansion requires:
  - Crystal level threshold
  - Mana pool investment
- Expansion zones are visible but locked
- Expansion only when high occupancy reached (recommended 80–90%)

Growth is visible and earned.

---

# 12. Systems Referenced But Not Defined Here

(Handled in Arcane Flow System)

- Mana generation math
- Crystal capacity scaling
- Infrastructure costs
- Mine bonuses
- Running maintenance systems

---

# Summary

The Claim System defines:

- Ownership
- Civic voting
- Prestige
- Migration
- Structural growth

It creates:

Political stability
Social pressure
Collective progression
Non-punitive incentives
Long-term city identity

This is the constitutional layer of Keystone.
