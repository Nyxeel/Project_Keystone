# Keystone – Resonance City System


## Vision

Keystone is a multiplayer PvE server built around **collective city progression** and long-term world evolution.

Each city is powered by a central **Resonance Crystal**.
This crystal is not a simple protection mechanic — it is the engine of growth, identity, and progression.

Cities evolve through player contribution.

# 1. Server Structure

## Hub World (Persistent City World)

- No resets
- Central social and economic space
- Player-owned plots
- Visible, expanding city infrastructure

Players build, trade, and invest in the city.

---

## Farm Worlds (Resetting Resource Worlds)

- Resource gathering
- PvE combat
- Rare materials
- Energy crystal drops

Farm worlds supply the resources that fuel city progression.

Energy acquisition is integrated into normal gameplay.

# 2. The Resonance Crystal

Each city has one central **Resonance Crystal**.

The crystal:

- Stores energy
- Enables upgrades
- Unlocks infrastructure
- Expands the city physically and functionally

Crystal upgrades are milestone events requiring:

- Refined energy
- Rare materials
- Community investment

Progression is intentionally long-term.

---

# 3. City Progression

As the crystal levels up, the city evolves.

Growth includes:

- Expanded buildable areas
- New public structures
- Additional NPC services
- Advanced crafting systems
- City-wide bonuses
- Special PvE event access

Progression is visible and architectural, not just numerical.

---

# 4. Energy System (Resonance)

Players generate energy through gameplay.

Energy is used for:

- City upgrades
- Public infrastructure
- Temporary bonuses
- Defensive systems
- Major community projects

The crystal has a storage capacity that increases per level.

When full, it may trigger:

- Special merchants
- Temporary resonance bonuses
- World events

Energy is collective and strategic.

---

# 5. Claim System

Each player plot contains a **Claim Crystal**.

- Manages ownership
- Displays contribution state
- Contributes indirectly to city resonance

Private plots remain protected and stable.

---

# 6. Economy

Currency:

- 100 Copper = 1 Silver
- 100 Silver = 1 Gold

Players earn income through:

- Trade
- Shops
- Crafting
- PvE rewards
- City participation

Gold sinks include:

- Infrastructure
- Public projects
- Services
- Cosmetics

The economy is player-driven and sink-balanced.

# Design Philosophy

- Cities grow through collective effort
- Progress unlocks opportunity, not obligation
- No artificial grind systems
- No forced event cycles
- Infrastructure shapes identity
- Energy represents civilization, not defense

The city does not hide from the world.

It becomes important to it.
